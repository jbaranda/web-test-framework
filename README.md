# Web Test Framework

## Overview
Started as a means for expanding my professional development skills and way to contribute back to the testing community, the Web Test Framework was created for testing web applications using different technologies.  The intent for this framework is to provide a base for creating tests in various programming languages.

I also plan to include several _training_ examples and lessons for the framework, different Software Testing technologies, and concepts to help others wanting to learn more about Software Testing
